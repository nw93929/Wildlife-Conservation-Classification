# Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification
https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/87/competition-image-classification-wildlife-conservation/page/409/

Can you classify the wildlife species that appear in camera trap images collected by conservation researchers?

Welcome to the African jungle! In recent years, automated surveillance systems called camera traps have helped conservationists study and monitor a wide range of ecologies while limiting human interference. Camera traps are triggered by motion or heat, and passively record the behavior of species in the area without significantly disturbing their natural tendencies.

However, camera traps also generate a vast amount of data that quickly exceeds the capacity of humans to sift through. That's where machine learning can help! Advances in computer vision can help automate tasks like species detection and classification, localization, depth estimation, and individual identification so humans can more effectively learn from and protect these ecologies.

In this challenge, we will take a look at object classification for wildlife species. Classifying wildlife is an important step to sort through images, quantify observations, and quickly find those with individual species.
